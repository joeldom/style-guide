### Case Study: Client Onboarding & Data Ingestion for Dreyfus

#### Defining the Problem
The client onboarding process up to this point was more-or-less a manual one the a client would need to reach out to an account rep. This process did not provide a standardized data-object and would then require both the client and sys-admin to then have to help setup.

- Complex account determination process
- Multi-step verification requirements
- Manual data verification bottlenecks
- Need for intelligent data seeding

#### Research
Through our research we aimed to determine how question sets could be used to funnel appropriate information while asking only questions pertinent to the account they were wanting to create.

- Analysis of existing onboarding workflows
- User interviews with clients and internal stakeholders
- Competitive analysis of other financial institutions
- Documentation of pain points in current verification process

#### Ideation
Smart form logic proved to be a cornerstone of the improved onboarding process. By implementing intelligent field dependencies and progressive disclosure patterns, we created a more intuitive flow that adapts to user inputs in real-time, significantly reducing confusion and error rates during the account setup process.

- Question matrix optimization
- Smart form field dependencies
- Automated verification checkpoints
- Data seeding automation possibilities

#### Analysis & Planning
Our analysis evolved into a comprehensive strategic framework. The user flow mapping created clear pathways through complex account determination scenarios, while detailed question matrix logic trees enabled sophisticated branching based on user responses. Data validation requirements were meticulously documented to ensure compliance with financial regulations and security standards. Integration points with existing systems were carefully mapped to maintain data consistency across platforms while enabling smooth information flow between legacy and new components.

- User flow mapping
- Question matrix logic trees
- Data validation requirements
- Integration points with existing systems

#### Design
Design focused on creating an intuitive interface that guides users naturally through complex processes. Progressive disclosure patterns reveal information at optimal moments, reducing cognitive load. Dynamic form fields adapt in real-time to user inputs, showing only relevant options. The status tracking interface provides clear visibility into the onboarding progress, while verification dashboards give administrators powerful oversight tools. The visual system maintains brand consistency while emphasizing clarity and trust.

- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Dynamic form fields
- Status tracking interface
- Verification dashboards

#### Prototyping
The prototyping brought these concepts to life through working models. The interactive question matrix demonstrated complex routing logic in action, while form validation flows simulated real-world usage patterns. Account type determination logic was refined through multiple iterations based on user feedback. Data seeding simulations verified the accuracy of automated systems and helped optimize performance. Each prototype phase revealed opportunities for enhancement before final implementation.

- Interactive question matrix
- Form validation flows
- Account type determination logic
- Data seeding simulations

#### Testing
Testing encompassed multiple validation layers to ensure system reliability. User acceptance testing with actual clients revealed practical usage patterns and pain points. Verification process validation confirmed regulatory compliance and security measures. Data accuracy checks ensured consistent reliable information flow. Performance metrics tracked system speed and efficiency under various load conditions. This comprehensive testing approach led to a robust final product ready for production deployment.

- User acceptance testing - Would users understand why they were being asked these questions? Would users be able to easily find the information being requested?
- Verification process validation
- Data accuracy checks - What was the minimal amount of information to setup an account that the verification agents would be able to act on.
- Performance metrics

#### Results & Launch
The automated data seeding capabilities delivered substantial efficiency gains across the platform. This system intelligently pre-populates relevant fields based on initial user inputs and existing data relationships, cutting down on repetitive data entry while maintaining high accuracy standards through built-in validation checks.

The impact on client experience has been transformative. Users report higher satisfaction with the streamlined process, citing reduced time investment and clearer guidance throughout the onboarding journey. The new system's ability to provide real-time feedback and status updates has particularly resonated with clients, leading to improved completion rates and reduced support queries.

- Streamlined onboarding process
- Reduced manual verification time
- Improved data accuracy
- Higher client satisfaction rates

#### Key Takeaways
We discovered an optimal balance between automation and manual verification processes. While automation handles routine checks and data validation, strategic manual touchpoints remain for complex cases requiring human judgment. This hybrid approach maintains security and compliance requirements while maximizing processing speed.

- Importance of smart form logic
- Value of automated data seeding
- Balance between automation and manual verification
- Impact on client experience


#### Future Considerations
Some future considerations would be better understanding of the data-object(s) that the system and thereby what the developers would design to have seed data for Account Creation.
