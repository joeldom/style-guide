### Case Study: Sandbox for Design & Development - Personal

#### Defining the Problem

When developing my site, I wanted to create a sandbox for design and development. I knew that as I made the components, I would need to test them and see how they worked.

It is important to let people experience things the way they choose to experience them. I believe this is why video games are so popular and important in experience design.
